## pyutils 
A collection of python scripts and tools that I developed along the way for fun, mostly. 

### python3-SimpleStuff ([github](https://github.com/subimal/python3-SimpleStuff) )

It has the following module
* ``math``: A set of trivial functions. The following functions are available.
  * ``IsPrime`` to test whether `n` is prime or not. 
  * ``gcd`` returns the greatest common divisor of a list of integers.
  * ``lcm`` returns the least common multiple of a list of integers.
Further details about their implementation are available [here](python3-SimpleStuff.md).

For usage check the wiki on it's github page.


### bitman ([github](https://github.com/subimal/bitman) )
A pure python module for managing/manipulating bits.







Disclaimer: I do not claim these to be the best in terms of design or performance. These work.
