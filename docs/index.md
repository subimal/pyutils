## pyutils 
A collection of python scripts and tools that I developed along the way for fun, mostly. 

### python3-SimpleStuff ([github](https://github.com/subimal/python3-SimpleStuff) )

It has the following module
* ``math``: A set of trivial functions. The following functions are available.
  * ``IsPrime`` to test whether `n` is prime or not. 
  * ``gcd`` returns the greatest common divisor of a list of integers.
  * ``lcm`` returns the least common multiple of a list of integers.
Further details about their implementation are available [here]().




### bitman ([github](https://github.com/subimal/bitman) )
A pure python module for managing/manipulating bits.

### Finding primes
I wrote bitman while revisiting the problem of generating primes. Generation of prime numbers can be easy to a very difficult task depending on how deep you delve into the problem. I looked at it from a relatively easier perspective. Take a look at the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_of_primes) for generation prime numbers. 

**Task:** Generate prime numbers from 1 to N where N is an integer.
